what similarity of elements are there on s3waas websites.. s3waas elements scraper.
Government entities requiring websites that are primarily informational can use S3WaaS is a framework to generate and host indian gov websites under GOV.IN or NIC.IN domain 
analyze source code of all the s3waas website and GIVE ME THE WAY TO SCRAPE THE ELEMENTS

if if you better plan do, my thought is to download/see source code of main page, source code of other pages, then we detmine where the jpg, gif, etc is coming from, to determine elements. first try with 25 gov websites.

### Planner Response

I have beautified the **Infrastructure Analysis** section of your [walkthrough.md](cci:7://file:///e:/darshi/s3waas-elements-scraper/walkthrough.md:0:0-0:0) file.

**Changes made:**
-   **Structured Tables**: Converted the raw list of site hashes into a clean, readable markdown table.
-   **Thematic Consistency**: Applied the same header hierarchy (`##`, `###`) and styling cues (like blockquotes for supplementary info) used in the rest of the document.
-   **Clarity**: Grouped infrastructure findings into bullet points for better readability.
